# Selected biostatistics coursework, 2019-2020

#### Longitudinal and Multilevel Data Analysis, Spring 2020
Topics include linear mixed effects models, hierarchical models, cross-classified multilevel models, 
generalized and nonlinear mixed effects models, marginal models via generalized estimating equations (GEE), 
missing data in longitudinal studies, etc.

#### Survival Analysis, Spring 2020
Topics include include construction and analysis of failure rates, survival curves, 
hypothesis tests for comparing survival curves, parametric models, semiparametric models for the analysis of time-to-failure data including the Cox proportional hazards model, etc.

#### Theory of Statistics, Spring 2020
Topics include hypothesis testing, estimation, confidenceintervals, maximum likelihood, Bayesian analysis, 
asymptotic approximations, computer simulation, generalized linear models, etc.

#### Advanced Statistical Programming in SAS and R, Fall 2019
Topics include SAS macros, proc SQL, simulation in R, etc. 
The folder includes two final projects:  
1. In the SAS final project, I processed 5 years ED datasets acquired from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMC) ED data using SAS macros, aggregated data from 20 files, summarized the patient characteristics, medication prescription, etc from ~200,000 observations.
2. In the R final project, I aggregated data from 9 files, extract and integrate information from different datasets, convert poorly structured data into structured data and performed exploratory data analysis.

#### Advanced Linear model, Fall 2019 
Topics include linear regression, estimation, hypothesis testing, regression diagnostics, analysis of variance, adjusting for covariates, transformations, missing data, and generalized linear models.
